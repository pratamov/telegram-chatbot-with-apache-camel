Telegram chat bot to learn common chinese mandarin words using Springboot and Apache Camel.
I am writing this code while waiting in an airport, so don't expect the quality.

## Flow

User: Typing anything to start
Bot: Give a mandarin word (challenge)
User: Retype the word
Bot: If the challenge and the user typing is same, Bot print the meaning in English and give challenge again.
